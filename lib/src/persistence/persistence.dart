/// Contains various persistence implementations (InMemory and File â€“persistences). These are
/// "abstract" persistences, which only connect to data sources and do not implement the operations
/// and methods for working the data. The classes that extend these persistences must implement this
/// logic on their own.
///
/// Identifiable Persistences work with Identifiable objects, which have primary keys. A few standard
/// operations are defined by default for these objects: reading arrays and data pages; searching for
/// an object by its id; and creating, updating, and deleting records of objects.
